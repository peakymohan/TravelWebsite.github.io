 currently done with front end design, now working on backend

 booking form backend complete

 **Follow this to properly work booking form**
 you have to create a 
 1. database named travelweb_db in localhost/phpmyadmin
 2. inside that create a table with 6 columns named booking_form
 3. structure is 
        book_id  int   primary key, tick on AI
        email   varchar 255
        whereTo varchar 255
        totalGuests varchar 255
        arrival varchar 255
        departure varchar 255
 4. save the table,  then booking form should work fine.

 **Backend Works**
  1. Booking
  2. Contactus
  3. User Registration
